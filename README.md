This project helped me improve my skills in:

- Using Bootstrap grid to create responsive two-column layouts
- Structuring semantic HTML sections for clarity and accessibility
- Applying custom styles on top of Bootstrap to match brand themes
- Working with forms inside responsive flexbox layouts

### Example snippet:

```HTML 
<form class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row gap-2 mt-3">
  <input type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter your email" required />
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary px-4">Get Started</button>
</form>
  ```

            **Continued development**
1. Adding animations or transitions to sections for a more dynamic experience
2. Creating a reusable Bootstrap theme to simplify future projects
