## What I learned

This project helped me improve my front-end development skills in:

- Styling cards with consistent spacing and hover animations using Bootstrap utilities
- Structuring semantic HTML for accessibility and clarity
- Practicing modular CSS with reusable classes and meaningful naming conventions
- Enhancing transitions and avatar design using custom styles

### Example snippet:

```css
.card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.02);
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;
}

.avatar {
  width: 2.5rem;
  height: 2.5rem;
  border-radius: 50%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
  
            **Continued development**
1. Enhancing hover and focus accessibility for keyboard users
2. Rebuilding the layout using CSS Grid for more layout control and flexibility

           **Useful resources**
1. Figma
2. WebAIM – Accessible Design Principles
3. MDN Web Docs - Flexbox – Helped clarify centering elements with Flexbox.
4. Hacker themes - Bootstrap Cheatsheet
